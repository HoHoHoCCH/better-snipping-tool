# better-snipping-tool
My attempt at creating a snipping tool more feature-rich than Microsoft's own Snip &amp; Sketch with Python. 

Currently, the snipping tool includes:

- Rectangular Snip
- Copy to clipboard and saving to file.
- Freeze Mode (Switch between snipping whats currently on your screen or snipping what was on your screen when you used the snip hotkey)
